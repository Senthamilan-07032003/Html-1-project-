    <h2>Specifications</h2>
    <p>LaFerrari is the first full hybrid produced by the Italian automotive marque, providing the highest power output of any Ferrari road car whilst decreasing fuel consumption by 40 per cent.LaFerrari's internal combustion petrol engine is a longitudinally rear mid-mounted Ferrari F140 direct fuel injected 65° V12 engine with a displacement of 6,262 cc (6.3 L) generating a maximum power output of 800 PS (588 kW; 789 hp) at 9,000 rpm and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque at 6,750 rpm, supplemented by a 163 PS (120 kW; 161 hp) KERS unit (called HY-KERS), which provides short bursts of extra power.The KERS system adds extra power to the combustion engine's power output level for a total of 963 PS (708 kW; 950 hp) and a combined torque of 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft).Ferrari claims CO2 emissions of 330 g/km. The engine's bore X stroke is 94 mm × 75.2 mm (3.70 in × 2.96 in) with a compression ratio of 13.5:1 and a specific power output of 94 kW (128 PS) per liter.

    <p>The car is equipped with carbon-ceramic Brembo brake discs at the front (398 mm) and rear (380 mm), The car is equipped with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires measuring 265/30 R 19 (front) and 345/30 R 20 (rear) respectively.The car uses a carbon fibre monocoque structure designed by Ferrari's F1 technical director Rory Byrne, with a claimed 27 per cent more torsional rigidity and 22 per cent more beam stiffness than its predecessor. It has a double wishbone suspension in the front and a multi-link suspension in the rear.LaFerrari has several electronic controls including an electronic stability control, high-performance ABS/EBD (anti-lock braking system/electronic brake distribution), EF1-Trac F1 electronic traction control integrated with the hybrid system, E-Diff 3 third-generation electronic differential, SCM-E Frs magnetorheological damping with twin solenoids (Al-Ni tube), and active aerodynamics, which are controlled by 21 of LaFerrari's onboard computers, to enable maximum performance.The body computer system is developed by Magneti Marelli Automotive Lighting.</p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>Ferrari states that the car has a top speed in excess of <b><u>350 km/h (220 mph)</u></b>. In terms of acceleration, it can go <b><u><i> 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.6 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in under 6.9 seconds, and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 15</i></u></b> seconds were announced by Ferrari.

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The design of the <b><i><U>V 12 flagship</U></i></b> received no input from Pininfarina, making it the first Ferrari since the Bertone-styled 1973 Dino 308 GT4 not to have Pininfarina bodywork or another styling. This decision is a rare exception to the collaboration between Ferrari and Pininfarina that began in 1951. However, Ferrari has stated that there are no plans to end business relations with Pininfarina</p>
    <p>The steering wheel has integrated controls and paddle-shifters directly fixed to the steering column, a solution that allows better use in all conditions. The "bridge" which exists between the two seats, designed like a suspended wing, is home to other instruments linked to the dual-clutch gearbox. The instrumentation consists of a 12.3-inch (310 mm) TFT display with the option to choose between two layouts and can host data from the telemetry system.</p>

    <h2>Recall</h2>
    <p>LaFerrari coupés were offered a replacement fuel tank due to the possible incorrect adhesion of a layer of paint on the fuel tank leading to a possible fire.</p>
    <P>Eighty-five LaFerrari coupés between 2014 and 2015 model years were recalled due to headrests from Lear's L32 seat failing to absorb the required amount of energy, and the tyre-pressure monitoring system displaying the wrong message when a tire suffered a puncture.</P>
